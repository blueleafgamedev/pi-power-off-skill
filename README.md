Allows mycroft to shutdown and reboot on raspberry pi, as well as restart all services if needed.

## About
I created this skill because i did not want to use picroft. instead, i used mycroft-core on raspbian 64 bit os. the shutdown skill that is currently installed does not utilize a command line call to sudo shutdown, sudo reboot, or bash mycroft-core/start-mycroft.sh all restart. utilizing this skill allows a user in my situation to restart mycroft's services, shutdown, and reboot their raspberry pi.

## Examples
* "Shutdown"
* "Goodnight"
* "Good night"
* "Power off"
* "Power down"
